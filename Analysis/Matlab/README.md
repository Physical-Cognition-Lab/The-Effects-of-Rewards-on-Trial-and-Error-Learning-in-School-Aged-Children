This Matlab code allows to analyze the results of an online experiment conducted at Birkbeck.

This experiment consisted of 2 versions, one in English and one in French, accessible through 2 separate links.

It was based on a between-subject design, with one factor (reward group), with three levels (1- Positive Reward group; 2- Negative Reward group; 3- No reward, Control group).

The main variables were performance measures (success rate, number of attempts and time per attempt) as well as strategy measures (distance of tool positioning between attempts, number of tools used, tool switching between successive attempts).

This Matlab code allows to:

- merge the csv files from the 2 links, both for participants' demographic data and for participants' results which were stored in separate csv files;

- clean the data;

- aggregate the data per reward group for the different performance and strategy measures;

- calculate the descriptive statistics and the inferential statistics (1-way ANOVA).

Further analyses were then conducted in R.
