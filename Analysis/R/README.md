# R code

## General intro
This R code was used to analyze the results of an online experiment conducted at Birkbeck.

This experiment consisted of 2 versions, one in English and one in French, accessible through 2 separate links.

It was based on a between-subject design, with one factor (reward group), with three levels (1- Positive Reward group; 2- Negative Reward group; 3- No reward, Control group).

The main variables were performance measures (success rate, number of attempts and time per attempt) as well as strategy measures (distance of tool positioning between attempts, number of tools used, tool switching between successive attempts).


## Files
- The Rewardanalysis_Anova.Rmd file explore the effect of the reward group on the performance measures using anovas.

- The Rewardanalysis.Rmd follows up the anova analysis by runnign linear model exploring the contribution of reward group and age on the different performance measures.
