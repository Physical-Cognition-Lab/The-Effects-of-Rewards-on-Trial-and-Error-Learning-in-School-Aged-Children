# The Effects of Rewards on Trial-and-Error Learning in School-Aged Children

## Abstract
Humans’ ability to rapidly identify appropriate actions in new situations is critical for survival and functional behaviour. This skill develops through trial and error, which is a reward-driven process. That is, humans get rewards for their actions, and through few attempts, they learn the optimal subsequent action. Here, we used tool use as a model system for understanding whether and how rewards affect children’s rapid trial-and-error learning. School-aged children (6- to 15-year-olds) played online tool-use games that involve reasoning about object movements and interactions with other objects. To solve the games, children had to apply their physical knowledge to cognitively reason about how to use the tools. Children received either high positive rewards for success (Positive-Rewards group), high negative rewards for failure (Negative-Rewards group), or no reward (Control group). We evaluated differences between the groups in terms of overall performance (success rate, average number of attempts and average attempt duration) and strategy (which tools were selected and where they were positioned). The Negative-Rewards group triumphed over all other groups. Children in this group succeeded more, used fewer attempts to solve the games, and applied more efficient strategies. Children in the Negative-Rewards group also showed significant improvement with age in both success and strategy selection. In contract, we did not find developmental changes in the Positive-Rewards or control groups. Our findings highlight the role of rewards in the development of trial-and-error learning, and suggest that negative rewards emerge as a powerful cognitive reinforcer during late childhood.

## Study
This study consisted of 2 versions, one in English and one in French, accessible through 2 separate links.

It was based on a between-subject design, with one factor (reward group), with three levels (1- Positive Reward group; 2- Negative Reward group; 3- No reward, Control group).

The main variables were performance measures (success rate, number of attempts and time per attempt) as well as strategy measures (distance of tool positioning between attempts, number of tools used, tool switching between successive attempts).
